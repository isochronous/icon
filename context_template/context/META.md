# META - .context Directory Maintenance Guide

## Purpose

This document explains when and how to update `.context/` documentation. The goal is a living knowledge base that captures what AI agents and developers need to know beyond what's obvious from the code itself.

## Separation of Concerns

`.claude/claude.md` and `.context/` serve different roles — avoid duplicating content between them.

| | `.claude/claude.md` (or `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) | `.context/` |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Big picture | Detailed, area-specific |
| **Content** | Project overview, tech stack, key commands, high-level conventions | Domain models, architectural patterns, coding standards, testing strategies |
| **Size** | Short (one file, quick to scan) | Structured (many files, read as needed) |
| **Example** | "We use Angular 18 with NGXS for state management" | Detailed NGXS action/state patterns with code examples |
| **Example** | "This app handles loan servicing and payment processing" | Detailed domain docs: `domains/payments.md`, `domains/loans.md`, `domains/state-management.md` |

When updating documentation, ask: is this a project-wide fact or convention? → `.claude/claude.md`. Is this detailed guidance for a specific area? → `.context/`.

## When to Update

Update documentation when:

1. **New patterns emerge**: A pattern used successfully 3+ times should be documented in `standards/` or `architecture/` with real code examples and guidance on when to use it.
2. **Standards evolve**: Team agrees on new conventions. Update the relevant file in `standards/`, mark old conventions as deprecated, and provide migration examples.
3. **Architecture changes**: Major refactoring or technology changes. Create or update migration guides in `architecture/` with before/after states and step-by-step migration paths.
4. **Lessons learned**: Retrospective identifies reusable insights. Promote from `retrospectives.md` to the appropriate subdirectory. See the [Retrospective Mechanism](#retrospective-mechanism) section.
5. **AI agents make repeated mistakes**: Clarify the problematic area with explicit examples. Add "do this / not this" guidance to the relevant file.
6. **Onboarding friction**: New developers or agents struggle with a concept. Expand explanations, add FAQ sections, and include more examples.
7. **Working in an undocumented domain area**: When code touches a domain not yet covered in `domains/`, create a file for that domain. This includes business domains (e.g., `payments.md`, `loans.md`) covering entities, business rules, and terminology, as well as technical domains (e.g., `routing.md`, `state-management.md`, `lifecycle.md`) covering system patterns, conventions, and integration points.

## What to Document

**Document (high value):**
- Non-obvious patterns that aren't clear from code alone
- The "why" behind architectural decisions (rationale and trade-offs)
- Common pitfalls with solutions
- Real examples with file paths (e.g., "see `src/features/auth/login.component.ts` lines 45-67")
- Migration paths between old and new patterns

**Skip (low value):**
- Language basics and standard features
- Content already in official framework documentation
- Patterns obvious from reading the code
- Duplicated content — link to the single source of truth instead

## Retrospective Mechanism

The retrospective system ensures lessons outlive individual tasks:

1. **At task completion**, the manager conducts a lightweight retrospective (see `workflows/task-plan/phase-completion.md`).
2. **Lessons are logged** in `retrospectives.md` as a rolling log (last 10 entries; cap enforced by `append-retrospective-entry`'s `ENTRY_CAP`) via that script — never by hand.
3. **Lessons are promoted** to the appropriate subdirectory:
   - Coding patterns → `standards/`
   - Testing insights → `testing/`
   - Architecture decisions → `architecture/`
   - Domain clarifications → `domains/`
4. **The rolling log** gives agents a quick-reference of recent lessons without reading every subdirectory.

## Directory Structure

```
.context/
├── META.md              # This file — maintenance guide
├── overview.md          # Project overview, tech stack, key concepts
├── decisions/           # Key project-wide decisions and rationale (one ADR per file)
├── retrospectives.md    # Rolling log of lessons learned (last 10)
├── architecture/        # System design, module structure, patterns
├── cache/               # Research reference documents cached by @researcher (3-day TTL, named <topic>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md)
├── domains/             # Domain docs: business (payments, loans) and technical (routing, state-management)
├── standards/           # Coding conventions, style, error handling
├── styling/             # UI/CSS conventions (if applicable)
├── testing/             # Test patterns, mocking strategies, coverage
├── tasks/               # Ephemeral task execution plans (prunable)
└── workflows/           # Persistent process docs: CI/CD, branching, deployment
```

**tasks/ vs workflows/**: Tasks are ephemeral (per-task execution plans, pruned after ~3 months). Workflows are persistent (CI/CD processes, branching strategies, deployment procedures).

## Quality Standards

Documentation should be: **accurate** (correct and current), **specific** (concrete guidance, not vague), **example-driven** (real code and file paths), **contextual** (explains why, not just what), and **non-duplicated** (single source of truth, link elsewhere).

## Maintenance

**After major tasks**: Review and update documentation affected by the work. Promote lessons from `retrospectives.md`. Mark deprecated patterns.

**Periodically**: Read through `.context/` files. Remove outdated content. Consolidate duplicates. Verify code examples still work and file paths still exist.

**Warning signs that docs need attention**: Developers or agents ask questions already answered in docs. New patterns go undocumented. Examples reference non-existent files. Agents make the same mistakes repeatedly.

## Context Recovery

When an AI agent's context window compacts mid-task:
1. Re-read `.claude/claude.md` (or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` as legacy fallback) (always)
2. Re-read `.context/` files relevant to the current task
3. Review the task document for status, decisions, and next steps
4. Resume from the documented progress point
